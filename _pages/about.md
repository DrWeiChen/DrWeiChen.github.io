Hi there! My name is Yixin Lu, and I am an associate professor at the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu). My research seeks to understand the broad impact of technological advances on individuals, organizations, and the society as a whole. I believe research can change the world by (i) improving our understanding of how the world functions, and (ii) inspiring new ideas and methods to tackle societal challenges. As such, I always strive to achieve a good balance between scientific rigor and practical relevance in my research endeavors. My scholarly works have been well received by the academic community as well as practitioners. I am the winner of the AIS Impact Award, the AIS Early Career Award, and the INFORMS ISS Design Science Award.
